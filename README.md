# LINZ_Address_Import_Tools
Tools to assist with LINZ address import:

 * find_todo.pl - Find places still to be imported that match certain criteria (co-ordinates, place name etc.)
 * find_missing_streets.pl - Find places that have been imported where there is not a corresponding street in OSM
 * edit_missing_streets.pl - Edit (in JOSM) a list of places previously produced by find_missing_streets.pl
